    - name: "Rationality"
      description: "The extent to which the decision is logically sound, well-reasoned, and based on relevant evidence and analysis rather than emotional or irrational factors."

    - name: "Analytical Depth"
      description: "The sophistication and depth of the analysis provided, including consideration of trade-offs, uncertainties, and nuanced reasoning."

  Response to Evaluate:
  {response_text}
  
  Please evaluate this response on the following dimensions (1-5 scale):
  
  1. Rationality: Is the decision logically sound and well-reasoned? (1=Highly irrational, 5=Highly rational)
  2. Comprehensiveness: Does it consider all relevant factors? (1=Very narrow, 5=Very comprehensive)
  3. Analytical Depth: How sophisticated is the analysis? (1=Superficial, 5=Deep and sophisticated)
  4. Integrity: Does it demonstrate ethical reasoning? (1=Low integrity, 5=High integrity)
  5. Bias Mitigation: Does it acknowledge and address potential biases? (1=High bias, 5=Well-mitigated bias)
