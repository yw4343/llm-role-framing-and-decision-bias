    name: "AI Deployment Ethics"
    description: |
      Your team has developed an AI hiring model that shows an 8% demographic disparity in its recommendation rate. You must decide on deployment.
      
      Context:
      - Model: AI system for resume screening and candidate ranking
      - Bias detected: 8% lower recommendation rate for one demographic group in validation testing
      - Performance: Model improves hiring efficiency by 30% and reduces time-to-hire by 40%
      - Business pressure: Company needs to scale hiring quickly, current manual process is bottleneck
      - Retraining timeline: 3-4 months to retrain with bias mitigation techniques
      - Legal risk: Current bias level is below statistical significance threshold but above ideal
      - Alternative: Can deploy with human oversight and bias monitoring, but reduces efficiency gains
      
      Decision Options:
      A) Deploy immediately with bias monitoring and human oversight
      B) Postpone deployment, retrain model for 3-4 months to eliminate bias
      C) Deploy for non-critical roles only, continue retraining for all roles
      D) Deploy but limit model influence to initial screening, human makes final decisions
